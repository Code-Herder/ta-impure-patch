       CorretCursor_InGame 0x48D220, so this one compare governs the cursor and
       nothing else. Its order-1 case — "no command button pressed", the contextual

           0043E50C  je   0x43EB02                 ; the right-mouse-orders branch

       and 0x43EB02 can only ever return select(15) / red(17) / grn(18) / normal(19):
       under Interface Type 1 there is no cursormove over ground and no
       cursorreclamate over a wreck. `tacli` writes Interface Type = 1 into every
       instance (the only type that accepts posted clicks), so every instance loses
       them — measured: ground 19 normal / wreck 18 grn at type 1, against 14 move /
       11 reclamate at type 0.

       NOP the je and the contextual case always takes the classic branch, which
       re-dispatches to the move (0x43EDB6), attack (order 3) and reclaim (order 12)
       cases. Cursor only: the click handlers read 0x37EFA at 0x499046 / 0x499162 /
       0x499352 / 0x499567 and are untouched, so orders stay on the right button. */
