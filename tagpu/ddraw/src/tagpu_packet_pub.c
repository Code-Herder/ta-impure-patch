/* tagpu_packet_pub.c — the frame packet's PUBLISHER (landing 1).
   Contract: tagpu_packet_pub.h. Design: research/notes/frame-packet-exchange.html
   §3 (the publish point), §8 (the loader thread and the out-of-game packet),
   §9 (the marker font as glyph bytes).

   THE ONE FILE THAT READS ENGINE MEMORY FOR THE PACKET, and it reads it on
   the game thread, inside an engine call, at a site that owns what it reads.
   Every address comes from inc/tagpu_engine.h; nothing here is dereferenced
   on the render thread.

   THE PUBLISH POINT is one observer (tagpu_detour_observe) on DrawGameScreen
   0x468CF0 — the site tagpu_menu.c already observes with the same six stolen
   bytes, so the chaining is proven, and ours is installed AFTER the menu's
   because its `before` never hijacks the return and ours must, for `after`.
   The observer acts only when the return address is 0x4969D2, the in-play
   frame callback's call (0x4969CD, `DrawGameScreen(1, 1)`): that gate
   excludes the shell, the screenshot function 0x495A30 (which calls
   DrawGameScreen in a loop while driving the eye, 0x495C76 with no flip and
   0x495E66 at the end), the movie recorder (0x4962C2), and — the reason it
   is a correctness gate and not a filter — every draw of the LOADING SCREEN,
   during which the loader thread owns the per-map arrays (below).
     before  = reserved for the commands (landing 2); a no-op today
     after   = the publish, post-flip, only when the cell holds no FRESH
               packet: the engine draws 330..4900 times a second against
               about 60 presents, so most draws cost one relaxed load
   The scenario applier's tick stub lands its jmp AT 0x4969D2 while a
   scenario is being applied; that changes the bytes there, not the return
   address the call pushed, so the gate holds with it installed.

   THE LOADER THREAD [VERIFIED by disassembly, 2026-09-12]. The game-screen
   enter callback 0x497F40 creates it at 0x4982CA (`push 0x497C70; call
   0x4B6B20`, the CRT's _beginthread over CreateThread + ResumeThread) and
   sets bit 0 of main+0x38D75 at 0x49832A. The thread's entry 0x497C70 is a
   SEH wrapper around 0x497180, the loader body (one function, one `ret` at
   0x497C6C), which calls LoadGameData_Main 0x4917D0 at 0x497581, sets bit 2
   at 0x4975C7 and waits for bit 3 in a SleepBatch100ms loop (0x4975DE..
   0x4975F1; the game thread clears bit 2 and sets bit 3 at 0x49855D/0x498576),
   and as its LAST act sets bit 1 at 0x497C5F/0x497C62. The game thread's
   callback tests bit 1 at 0x498342 before installing the in-play handler. So
   "the game thread owns all of main" is false during a load and true for
   every in-play draw — exactly the set the return-address gate selects, and
   what closes the audit's begin/end hazard by ORDERING rather than by speed.
   No instruction clears bit 0 or bit 1 (every reference to the word is
   listed in the exe note), so whether they are reset between two games in
   one process is settled by the log lines here, not by the disassembly.
   The observer on 0x497C70 (stolen `55 8B EC 6A FF`, position-independent)
   logs the loader's thread id at its entry — the direct measurement the plan
   asked for, in place of the call-chain inference.

   THE FONT, AS BYTES. The marker block's font (`[globals+0x204]`) and text
   colour (`+0x208`) are latched at hook 8 (0x469BD7, markown's stub), the
   instant the block that draws the group digit and the ShowRanges labels
   begins — nothing between there and the digit's own draw at 0x469CF9 calls
   SetFont. Until this landing the render thread dereferenced that font
   behind IsBadReadPtr; no note establishes a UI font's lifetime, and a probe
   is not a lifetime argument (CLAUDE.md). Now the game thread copies the
   font's header and its 95 printable glyphs into a game-side buffer whenever
   the pointer or the header signature changes, each glyph as a one-glyph
   font object the engine's own blitter accepts, and every packet carries the
   buffer (~1.5 KB for a stock font). The copy walks the font exactly as the
   blitter does for the same characters, on the same thread, while the font
   is the engine's current one — the reads it makes are the reads the engine
   makes for the string it is about to draw. */
